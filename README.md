# Prime Number Checker in C

## Overview
This C program checks whether a given number is **prime** or **not**.

## How It Works
1. The user enters an integer.
2. The program determines if the number is prime:
   - If the number is **less than 2**, it is not prime.
   - If the number has divisors other than 1 and itself, it is not prime.
   - Otherwise, it is prime.
3. The result is displayed.
